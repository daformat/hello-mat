# Hello, I'm Mat

This is my professionnal website, available at [hello-mat.com](http://hello-mat.com).

[My previous website](http://mathieujouhet.com) was nice but it was a pain to maintain.
I made it in 2012 when css3 support started to be decent across a wide range of browsers.
Yet at this time, I didn't use any javascript framework and everything was done by hand, 
with the help of jQuery.

Things have changed quite a bit since then, and I recently fell in love with 
facebook's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), so I decided 2017 was 
the aprropriate time to start working on a new website, using all the cool new
things I learnt in-between.

Feel free to use this as a learning material.

Please **don't use it commercially** without asking me first, I want to make 
sure you change more than just the logo before allowing you to do so.

If you feel like it helped you, please let me know by 
[sending me a tweet](https://twitter.com/daformat).

Work in progress.

As of 2017/02/01 I made a nice placeholder with a useless yet fun javascript particles animation:
